# Skyrim-Exergame-Mod
A Skyrim mod that turns it into an Asynchronous Exergame

This mod will allows users to record their physical activity at exercise.com and depending on what activities were done,
a proportionate amount of exp will be added to their in-game character. The stat distribution into health stamina and magicka
will be dependant on what exercises were done and what fraction of these contributed to the level up.
